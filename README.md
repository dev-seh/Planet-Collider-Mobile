Description:
"Planet Collider" is an engaging mobile game built using the Unity game engine. In this game, players are tasked with controlling two satellites orbiting around a static Earth located at the center of the screen. The primary goal is to avoid asteroids that threaten these satellites. The stakes rise as players can also swipe across these asteroids to destroy them, ensuring the safety of the satellites. However, the real challenge is ensuring that the two satellites never touch the Earth.

Key Features:

Dynamic Satellite Movement:

The satellites are not static. They move around, starting with a slow pace and gradually increasing in speed as time progresses. This creates an escalating challenge, demanding faster reactions and strategic planning from the player as the game progresses.
Satellites possess the ability to bounce back when they collide with the edges of the screen, adding an additional layer of dynamics to the gameplay.

Asteroid Mechanics:

Asteroids sporadically enter the game scene, threatening the safety of the satellites.
Players can swipe across the screen, creating a visible 'cut' that destroys any asteroid it touches. This not only adds a layer of offense for the player but also requires precise timing.

Diverse Object Movement:

Various game objects, including the menacing asteroids, exhibit random movement patterns, making each gameplay experience unique.

Scalable Difficulty:

As time goes by, the game's difficulty scales, demanding more from the player. This ensures that the gameplay remains challenging and avoids monotony.
